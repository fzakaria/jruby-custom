# JRuby Nix Custom

This is a sample template on how you might want to build JRuby using Nix for any commit.

The typical derivation included in _nixpkgs_ builds from a released distribution artifact, however if you want to build arbitrary commits it can be difficult.

This template makes it easy to change to any commit and get a working JRuby installation.
